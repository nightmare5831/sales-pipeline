# Sales Pipeline - Implementation Status

## TL;DR
Built a **fully functional kanban board UI** matching the Figma design. Frontend is 100% complete with mock data. Backend/API integration is next.

---

## ✅ What's Done (Phase 1: Frontend)

### **Core Features**
- **Kanban Board**: 12-column pipeline (Leads → Closed/Dead/Follow-up)
- **Drag & Drop**: Smooth DnD using `@dnd-kit`
- **Deal Cards**: Full info display (contact, products, financials, payment progress)
- **Add Deal Modal**: Form to create new deals
- **Summary Stats**: Total pipeline value, margin, deal count
- **No Sidebar**: Clean full-width layout

### **Tech Stack**
```
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- @dnd-kit/core + sortable + utilities
- Mock data (11 deals, 10 contacts, 13 products)
```

### **Project Structure**
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── pipeline/page.tsx          # Main pipeline route
│   └── page.tsx                   # Landing page
├── components/pipeline/
│   ├── PipelineBoard.tsx          # Main container + state + DnD
│   ├── PipelineColumn.tsx         # Column component
│   ├── DealCard.tsx               # Card with all deal info
│   └── AddDealModal.tsx           # Create deal form
├── lib/mock-data.ts               # Sample data
└── types/pipeline.ts              # TS types
```

### **Key Files**
- `PipelineBoard.tsx` - State management, DnD logic, summary calculations
- `DealCard.tsx` - Draggable card with products, margins, payment bars
- `mock-data.ts` - 11 realistic deals with financial data

## ⏳ What's Missing (Phase 2 & 3: Backend)

### **Backend**
- [ ] Database (Supabase/Prisma + PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Auth (Supabase Auth/Auth0)
- [ ] API routes (CRUD for deals)
- [ ] Real-time sync (WebSocket/Pusher)

### **API Integrations**
- [ ] Gmail API - email threads per deal
- [ ] Twilio API - SMS activity tracking
- [ ] Shopify API - order/product sync

### **Additional Features**
- [ ] Deal detail view/edit
- [ ] Activity timeline
- [ ] File attachments
- [ ] Admin panel for API config
- [ ] Analytics/reporting

## 🎨 UI Features Implemented

### **Visual Design**
- Color-coded badges (DOM, HK, DROPSHIP)
- Avatar initials for contacts
- Product images with quantities
- Margin color coding (green ≥20%, blue 15-19%, orange <15%)
- Payment progress bars
- Horizontal scroll for columns, vertical for cards

### **Interactions**
- Drag deals between any stage
- Click "+ Add Deal" → modal form
- Real-time summary updates
- Smooth animations & transitions

---

## 🚀 Current Functionality

### **Works Now**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/pipeline
```

- View full kanban board
- Drag & drop deals between stages
- Add new deals via modal
- See all deal details on cards
- Auto-calculated totals

### **Doesn't Persist**
- No database (changes lost on refresh)
- No auth (public access)
- No real API data (mock only)

## 📝 Original Requirements vs. Implementation

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Build from Figma design | ✅ | Pixel-perfect match |
| Vercel deployment ready | ✅ | Just needs `vercel deploy` |
| Kanban board with DnD | ✅ | Fully functional with mock data |
| Dynamic API updates | ❌ | Gmail/Twilio/Shopify pending |
| Real-time refresh | ❌ | WebSocket not implemented |
| User authentication | ❌ | Not started |
| Data persistence | ❌ | No database yet |
| Admin settings | ❌ | Not started |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Phase 2: Backend (2 weeks)**
1. Set up Supabase/Prisma + PostgreSQL
2. Create database schema (deals, contacts, products)
3. Build CRUD API routes
4. Add authentication
5. Migrate mock data to DB

### **Phase 3: APIs (3 weeks)**
1. Gmail OAuth + thread fetching
2. Twilio SMS webhooks
3. Shopify product/order sync
4. WebSocket for real-time updates

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**Delivered:** Production-ready frontend matching Figma spec with full drag-and-drop functionality.

**Remaining:** Backend plumbing (DB, auth, API integrations).

**Demo:** Run `npm run dev` → navigate to `/pipeline` → drag deals, click Add Deal button.

**Code Quality:** Clean, typed, modular, ready for backend integration.
